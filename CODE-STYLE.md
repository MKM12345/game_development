# Code Style and Conventions

This document outlines the coding style and conventions to be followed when contributing to the game_development project. Adhering to a consistent code style helps maintain readability and consistency across the codebase.

## Python Version

We use Python 3 for the game_development project. Ensure that your code is compatible with Python 3.

## Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

## Whitespace

- Avoid trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code for readability.
- Keep lines of code limited to 79 characters for code and 72 characters for comments and docstrings. If a line exceeds these limits, it should be broken into multiple lines for improved readability.

## Naming Conventions

- Variables and function names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `my_variable`, `my_function()`).
- Class names should use CamelCase (e.g., `MyClass`).
- Constants should be in uppercase with words separated by underscores (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`).

## Comments

- Use descriptive comments to explain the purpose and functionality of your code.
- Inline comments should be used sparingly and should add value to the code.
- Commented-out code should be avoided; remove unused code instead.

## Documentation

- Use docstrings to document classes, functions, and modules. Follow Python's docstring conventions.
- Provide clear and concise documentation for public APIs.

## Imports

- Use absolute imports for standard library modules and relative imports for project-specific modules.
- Avoid wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`) as they can make it unclear which symbols are in use.

## Function and Method Definitions

- Define functions and methods with meaningful names that describe their purpose.
- Keep functions and methods focused on a single, well-defined task.
- Avoid overly long or complex functions.

## Code Organization

- Organize code into logical modules and packages.
- Use well-structured directory layouts to group related code.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for code as necessary to ensure functionality and maintainable code.
- Follow testing best practices, including arranging tests in a clear directory structure and naming test files consistently.

This document should serve as a guideline for coding style and conventions in the game_development project. Consistency in code style and organization contributes to better maintainability and collaboration.
